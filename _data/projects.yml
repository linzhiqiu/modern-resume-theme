    Phishing attacks are a major problem, as evidenced by the
    DNC hackings during the 2016 US presidential election, in
    which staff were tricked into sharing passwords by fake Google security emails, granting access to confidential information. Vulnerabilities such as these are duein part toinsufficient
    and tiresome user training in cybersecurity. Ideally, we would
    have more engaging training methods that teach cybersecurity in an active and entertaining way. To address this need, we
    introduce the game What.Hack, which not only teaches phishing concepts but also simulates actual phishing attacks in a
    role-playing game to encourage the player to practice defending themselves. Our user study shows that our game design is
    more engaging and effective in improving performance than
    a standard form of training and a competing training game
    design (which does not simulate phishing attempts through
    role-playing).
